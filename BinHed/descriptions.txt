Header

Offset# Size (in bytes) Purpose 
0 2 Reserved. Should always be 0. 
2 2 Specifies image type: 1 for icon (.ICO) image, 2 for cursor (.CUR) image. Other values are invalid. 
4 2 Specifies number of images in the file. 

Structure of image directory

Image #1 Data for the first image 
Image #2 Data for the second image 
...  
Image #n Data for the last image 

Image

Offset# Size (in bytes) Purpose 
0 1 Specifies image width in pixels. Can be any number between 0 to 255. Value 0 means image width is 256 pixels. 
1 1 Specifies image height in pixels. Can be any number between 0 to 255. Value 0 means image height is 256 pixels. 
2 1 Specifies number of colors in the color palette. Should be 0 if the image is truecolor. 
3 1 Reserved. Should be 0.[Notes 1] 
4 2 In .ICO format: Specifies color planes. Should be 0 or 1.[Notes 2] 
In .CUR format: Specifies the horizontal coordinates of the hotspot in number of pixels from the left.
 
6 2 In .ICO format: Specifies bits per pixel. [Notes 3] 
In .CUR format: Specifies the vertical coordinates of the hotspot in number of pixels from the top.
 
8 4 Specifies the size of the bitmap data in bytes 
12 4 Specifies the offset of bitmap data address in the file 


PNG
===
A PNG file starts with an 8-byte signature. The hexadecimal byte values are 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A; the decimal values are 137 80 78 71 13 10 26 10. Each of the header bytes is there for a specific reason:[5]

Bytes Purpose 
89 Has the high bit set to detect transmission systems that do not support 8 bit data and to reduce the chance that a text file is mistakenly interpreted as a PNG, or vice versa. 
50 4E 47 In ASCII, the letters PNG, allowing a person to identify the format easily if it is viewed in a text editor. 
0D 0A A DOS-style line ending (CRLF) to detect DOS-Unix line ending conversion of the data. 
1A A byte that stops display of the file under DOS when the command type has been used—the end-of-file character 
0A A Unix-style line ending (LF) to detect Unix-DOS line ending conversion.
